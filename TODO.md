# Custom Order Feature Implementation

## Backend
- [x] Create CustomOrder model (server/models/CustomOrder.js)
- [x] Add CustomOrder import to server/server.js
- [x] Add POST /api/custom-orders route with image upload support

## Frontend
- [x] Create CustomOrderPage component (src/pages/CustomOrderPage.tsx)
- [x] Add CustomOrderPage import to src/App.tsx
- [x] Update /custom route to use CustomOrderPage instead of ProductsPage

## Testing
- [ ] Test the custom order form submission
- [ ] Verify image upload functionality
- [ ] Check backend API response
- [ ] Ensure the page is accessible at http://localhost:4000/custom

## Notes
- All fields in the custom order form are optional as requested
- The backend API accepts custom orders from both authenticated and unauthenticated users
- Images are uploaded to the same uploads directory as other files
- The promise of lower prices is displayed in the success message
