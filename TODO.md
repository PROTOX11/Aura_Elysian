# Dynamic Filter System Implementation

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Filter Context System
- **FilterContext.tsx**: Created a comprehensive React context for managing filter state and options
  - Dynamic filter options (festivals, fragrances, themes, weights, categories, price ranges)
  - Filter state management (selected filters, price range)
  - Loading and error states
  - Reset and refresh functionality

### 2. Custom Hook for Filter Logic
- **useFilters.ts**: Created a custom hook that provides:
  - `useFilters()`: Access to filter context
  - `useProductFilters()`: Product filtering logic with memoization
  - Active filter count calculation
  - Efficient product filtering based on multiple criteria

### 3. Updated ProductsPage
- **ProductsPage.tsx**: Completely refactored to use dynamic filters:
  - Replaced hardcoded filter arrays with dynamic options from context
  - Added support for themes, weights, and categories filters
  - Implemented reset filters functionality
  - Added loading indicators for filter operations
  - Improved UI with scrollable filter sections
  - Better empty state handling

### 4. App Integration
- **App.tsx**: Added FilterProvider to the component tree
  - Wrapped the entire app with FilterProvider
  - Proper provider hierarchy (FilterProvider > CartProvider)

### 5. Product Form Integration
- **AddProductForm.tsx**: Added filter refresh after product creation
  - Automatically refreshes filter options when new products are added
  - Ensures filter options stay up-to-date with product data

## üîß Key Features Implemented

### Dynamic Filter Options
- **Festivals**: Dynamically loaded from API
- **Fragrances**: Dynamically loaded from API
- **Themes**: Dynamically loaded from API
- **Weights**: Dynamically loaded from API
- **Categories**: Dynamically loaded from API
- **Price Range**: Dynamically calculated from product data

### Filter State Management
- **Selected Filters**: Multi-select for festivals, fragrances, themes, weights, categories
- **Price Range**: Dual-range slider with dynamic min/max
- **Reset Functionality**: One-click reset to default state
- **Active Filter Count**: Visual indicator of applied filters

### Performance Optimizations
- **Memoized Filtering**: Products are filtered efficiently using useMemo
- **Context Optimization**: Filter state changes trigger minimal re-renders
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during filter operations

### User Experience Improvements
- **Scrollable Filter Sections**: Long filter lists are scrollable
- **Visual Feedback**: Loading dots and active filter indicators
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop
- **Intuitive UI**: Clear labels and consistent styling

## üß™ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test filter functionality with various product combinations
- [ ] Verify filter reset works correctly
- [ ] Test loading states and error handling
- [ ] Check responsive design on mobile devices
- [ ] Verify filter refresh after product creation
- [ ] Test with empty product lists

## üìù Notes

- The system is designed to be extensible and maintainable
- All filter logic is centralized in the FilterContext
- ProductsPage automatically adapts to new filter types
- The system gracefully handles missing or empty filter options
- Performance is optimized for large product catalogs
